<h1 style="font-size: 28px;">Fuck long distance, we're having the time of our lives</h1>
<p>This project is built with <a href="d3js.org">D3.js</a> as a gift for my boyfriend as a celebration of our 3 years together.</p>
<h2>The spiral</h2>
<p>The idea of a spiral has been haunting me for a while now. I love circular visualisations and I'm fascinated by the beauty of the spiral's geometry. My inspiration came from tree rings: each year, another ring gets added to the trunk of the tree. By reading the texture and look of the rings, one can tell about its growth and its environment.</p>

<p>The d3.js spiral was made with the help of <a href="https://github.com/WesTyler/SpiralJS">Wes Tyler's Spiral.js</a>. 
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>One day my boyfriend and I thought it interesting to know how long we've been physically together. So we looked through our e-mails for plane tickets and other similar data. We were also curious about:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many cities we visited together</li>
<li>How long was the longest period apart or the longest together </li>
<li>Who made most trips to visit the other</li>
</ul>
<p>For this we compiled an Excel sheet with all these dates, and then we calculated those numbers. But it always felt it was missing something: it was missing its colour, its magic...</p>
<p>As our 3rd anniversary approached, I've been thinking about what would be the perfect celebration for it. I've already been brooding on the idea of visualising the Excel data for a while, so I decided to build it up.</p>

<p>However, the data was incomplete and in an improper form. I wanted to have an account of the cities we visited, together or individually. For that I had to look at meta-data from the photos we took in our travels.</p>


<h2>The code</h2>
<p>I know. It's a mess. But it works and I'm happy about it :D</p>
