<h1 style="font-size: 28px;">Fuck long distance, we're having the time of our lives</h1>
<p>This project is built with <a href="d3js.org">D3.js</a> as a gift for my boyfriend as a celebration of our 3 wonderful years together.</p>
<h2>The spiral</h2>
<p>The idea of a spiral has been haunting me for a while now. I love circular visualisations and I always was fascinated by the beauty of the spiral's geometry. The current spiral is an Archimede's Spiral, written with the help of <a href="https://github.com/WesTyler/SpiralJS">Wes Tyler's Spiral.js</a>. 
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>One sunny day we both sat down and started looking through our e-mails for plane tickets. It was just some curiosities we had: </p>
<ul>
<li>How many days have we spent together-together?</li>
<li>How many cities did we visit together? </li>
<li>How long was the longest period apart?</li>
<li>How long was the longest period together?</li>
</ul>
<p>For this we compiled an Excel sheet with all these dates, and then we calculated those numbers. But it always felt it was missing something, it was missing its colour, its magic...</p>
<p>Later on, when our anniversary approached, I've already been brooding on the idea for quite a while, so I decided to build it up. However, the data was incomplete and not in a proper form. I also added other cities that we've visited individually. </p>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>It's true, we've been quite local, we stayed in Europe, even if he is from Peru. But that turned out fine, as a visualisation of the whole world would have been harder to fit in :) </p>
<p>For the map visualisation I've used <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/milafrerichs/69035da4707ea51886eb">TopoJSON as presented by Mila Frerichs</a></p>

<h2>The code</h2>
<p>I know. It's a mess. But it works and I'm happy about it :D</p>
